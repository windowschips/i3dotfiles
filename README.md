..and this video is just a small part of the many features provided!
### Before you use:
- Only tested on Fedora Workstation 39, using ASUS F555L Laptop. I have only one monitor. (internal display)
- I am not responsible for any computer errors or damage, but feel free to make issue on the repository and I will try helping.
- Make sure to read all sections of this file so no confusion occurs.
- These dotfiles are not meant to be used as is, and you may have to make some changes if you have a different setup from mine.


With that being said, let's move on to how to install it.
### Applications and programs:
Most applications and programs which are required are listed in Requirements section. If you don't want to use a specific program, you can try editing the configs and substituting the program. If I missed any program, make issue on repository and I will add it to the section.

</details>

### Install the configs:
Make sure you have GNU Stow installed. After which you can follow these steps:
- Clone repository into **your home folder**, and rename it to `.dotfiles`.
- `cd` into the `.dotfiles` folder.
- Run `./stow.sh`. This will symlink the files (GTK configs, rofi menus, i3 config, etc.) to their locations.
- If it says `Stowing complete.` in your terminal, it is successful.
### FAQ
I don't know how to use your i3 configuration.

^ Press Win+Space and open your favorite text editor. Use it to view the i3 config file and see the keybindings. If you want, you can change the keybinds also and reset i3 with Win+R.

I changed the names, locations, etc of the directories, now my configurations is broken.

^ No worries, run `./stow.sh` again and all should be fixed.

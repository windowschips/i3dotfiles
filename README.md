### Before you use:
- Tested on ASUS F555L Laptop with:
  - Fedora Workstation 39
  - Fedora Everything 39 (with Fedora i3 software)
- Made for use with **one 1920x1080** monitor. Adjustments to the configs will be neccessary for higher/lower resolutions and/or more monitors.
- Make sure to read all sections of this file so no confusion occurs.
- These dotfiles are not meant to be used as is, and you may have to make some changes if you have a different setup from mine.
- Upon installing, you may have to set the wallpaper from nitrogen manually.

### Programs:
Most of the necessary programs are listed in the dropdown below. If you don't want to use a specific program, you can try editing the configs and substituting the program. If I missed any program, [make issue](https://github.com/windowschips/i3dotfiles/issues) on the repository and I will add it to the section.

</details>

### Install the configs:
Make sure you have GNU Stow installed. After which you can follow these steps:
- Clone repository into **your home folder**, and rename it to `.dotfiles`.
- `cd` into the `.dotfiles` folder.
- Run `./stow.sh`. This will symlink the files (GTK configs, rofi menus, i3 config, etc.) to their locations.
- Login into i3! 
### FAQ
I don't know how to use your i3 config.

^ Press Win+Space and open your favorite text editor. Use it to view the i3 config file and see the keybindings. If you want, you can change the keybinds also and reset the desktop (picom, i3, dunst, etc) with Win+R. Show off to your friends using the screenshot tool by pressing Win+Shift+S. The screenshot will be copied to clipboard.

I changed the names, locations, etc of the directories, now my configs is broken.

^ No worries, run `./stow.sh` again and all should be fixed.

### Installation
Requirements:
- GNU Stow

Follow these steps:
- Clone repository into **your home folder**, and make sure its name is ".dotfiles". `git clone https://github.com/windowschips/i3dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- Change directory into it. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- Run "stow.sh". This will symlink the important configs to their locations. `./stow.sh`
- Login into i3! - `startx` or use your display manager
### Post-install

Some basic keybinds are:
- Super + Space : Apps menu
- Super + R     : Reload desktop
- Super + Shift/Ctrl + S : Screenshot area/fullscreen
- The rest can be viewed in the i3 config (~/.dotfiles/layout/i3/config).

You should:
- Set the wallpaper in nitrogen
- Create a file named .owm-key in ~, and change the weather location in ~/.dotfiles/layout/polybar/weather-plugin.sh
- Set up themes, cursors and icons of your choice.
